# CNN_ResNet_comparison
Compares two different neural network architectures (convolutional neural networks and ResNet18) as well as multiple different configurations of the two's parameters and characteristics, to analyse which performed best on the dataset as dictated by the chosen metrics.

A more detailed description is given [in this report](CNN_ResNet_comparison\Report.pdf).
