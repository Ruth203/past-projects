# GAN_malware_detection
This was part of my final year project looking into the viability of using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to assist malware detection systems in identifying abnormal traffic, specifically when there was a quantitative lack of data on attacks.

Using a cleaned dataset of various benign and malware attack traffic collected by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity, GANs were used to train off the dataset, and then produce synthesised data based on learnt patterns. Supplimented into the original dataset, a malware detection model then trained on both the original dataset and the supplimented dataset separately for comparison in overall performance.

This code shows this process and the collection of different metrics for later analysis.
